## Introduction

In this epic journey, you'll embark on a quest to explore mystical lands and encounter fantastical creatures‚Äîall while searching for the ultimate snack. Will you find the legendary **Cheese Puff of Destiny** or be devoured by the dreaded **Nacho Monster**? Only time will tell!

## Getting Started

To get started, you‚Äôll need Python installed on your machine. Don‚Äôt worry; it‚Äôs not as scary as a dragon!

2. **Clone this repository** (or just copy the code if you‚Äôre feeling rebellious).
3. **Run the game**: Open a terminal and type `python adventure_game.py` (don‚Äôt forget to change into the directory where you saved the file).

## Gameplay

1. Choose a location (Forest, Cave, or Castle).
2. Encounter wacky events and creatures.
3. Decide if you want to explore again or take a snack break (because snacks are important!).

## Encounters

Here are some *totally realistic* encounters you might experience:

- A wild bear that just wants to hug you.
- A friendly elf offering you snacks (they're magical!).
- A hidden treasure... that turns out to be just an empty chip bag.
